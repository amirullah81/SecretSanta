# SecretSanta

Part one:
Imagine that every year your extended family does a "Secret Santa" gift exchange. For this gift exchange, each person draws another person at random and then gets a gift for them. Write a program that will choose a Secret Santa for everyone given a list of all the members of your extended family. Obviously, a person cannot be their own Secret Santa.

Part two:
After the third year of having the Secret Santa gift exchange, you’ve heard complaints of having the same Secret Santa year after year. Modify your program so that a family member can only have the same Secret Santa once every 3 years.
Part three:

As your extended family has grown, members have gotten married and/or had children. Families usually get gifts for members of their immediate family, so it doesn’t make a lot of sense for anyone to be a Secret Santa for a member of their immediate family (spouse, parents, or children). Modify your program to take this constraint into consideration when choosing Secret Santas.
